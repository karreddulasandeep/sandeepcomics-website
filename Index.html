    <h2>HTML:</h2>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of
      1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
      used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4] The first publicly available
      description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned
      on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18
      elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except
      for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an
      in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation
      format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8] HTML is
      a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text,
      images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default
      characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
      and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page
      designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned
      in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
      describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that
      used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
      (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting
      commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
      format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based
      on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely
      print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
      progressively moved in this direction with CSS. Berners-Lee considered
      HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the
      Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of
      the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
      Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which
      included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The
      draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of
      the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
      reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful
      prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+
      (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
      already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11] After the
      HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML
      Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first
      HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which
      future implementations should be based.[12] Further development under the
      auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the
      HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial
      software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000,
      HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
      published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In
      2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application
      Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with
      the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October
      2014.[14]

    <h2 id="section-css">CSS:</h2>
    <p>
      CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[23] At the
      time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[24] Several other
      style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and
      discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium
      resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25] being released in
      1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became
      co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[26] Style sheets
      have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard
      Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to
      provide style sheets for the web.[27] One requirement for a web style
      sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the
      web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were
      not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced
      by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[27] As HTML grew,
      it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the
      demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control
      over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web
      browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[28] made
      consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how
      web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee
      had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets
      could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[24] Robert
      Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the
      presentation so that different style sheets could describe different
      presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[28]
      Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in
      the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed
      on the www-style mailing list.[27] Of these nine proposals, two were
      especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[23]
      and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[26][29] Two browsers served
      as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to
      implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[30][31][32] Bert Bos
      implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[26] Thereafter, Lie
      and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed
      from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other
      markup languages besides HTML).[24] Lie's proposal was presented at the
      "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, Illinois
      in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[24] Around this time the W3C was
      already being established and took an interest in the development of CSS.
      It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by Steven Pemberton. This
      resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML
      editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff
      on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including Thomas
      Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996, Netscape
      Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language
      called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS).[24] The spec was never finished,
      and is deprecated.[33] By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become
      official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.
      Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one
      group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was
      split into three working groups: HTML Working Group, chaired by Dan
      Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad;
      and CSS Working Group, chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C. The CSS Working
      Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1,
      resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was
      published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was
      started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014. In 2005, the CSS
      Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more
      strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3
      Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation
      to Working Draft level. Difficulty with adoption The CSS 1 specification
      was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[24] was released
      that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x
      added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many bugs that
      prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years
      before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the
      specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March
      2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS 1
      support,[34] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its
      introduction of CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers
      followed soon afterward, and many of them additionally implemented parts
      of CSS 2. However, even when later "version 5" web browsers began to offer
      a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain
      areas. They were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs, and other quirks.
      Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. x for Windows, as opposed to the very
      different IE for Macintosh, had a flawed implementation of the CSS box
      model, as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and
      variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a
      consistent appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of
      workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE Windows box model bugs
      were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released, Microsoft
      introduced a backward-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ("quirks
      mode") alongside an alternative, corrected "standards mode". Other
      non-Microsoft browsers also provided mode-switch capabilities. It,
      therefore, became necessary for authors of HTML files to ensure they
      contained special distinctive "standards-compliant CSS intended" marker to
      show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted correctly, in
      compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now
      long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker, web browsers with
      the "quirks mode"-switching capability will size objects in web pages as
      IE 5 on Windows would, rather than following CSS standards. Problems with
      the patchy adoption of CSS and errata in the original specification led
      the W3C to revise the CSS 2 standards into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to
      a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2
      properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a
      few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line
      with the predominant existing implementations. CSS 2.1 became a Candidate
      Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS 2.1 was pulled back to
      Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[35] and only returned to Candidate
      Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.[36] In addition to these problems,
      the .css extension was used by a software product used to convert
      PowerPoint files into Compact Slide Show files,[37] so some web servers
      served all .css[38] as MIME type application/x-pointplus[39] rather than
      text/css.

    <h2>Comics By Stan Lee:</h2>
    <p>
      Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber[1] /ËliËbÉr/; December 28, 1922 â
      November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher,
      and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called
      Timely Comics which would later become Marvel Comics. He was the primary
      creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small
      division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated
      the comics and film industries. In collaboration with others at
      Marvelâparticularly co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditkoâhe
      co-created iconic characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men,
      Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black
      Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow.
      These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more
      naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged
      the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to
      changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel
      properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his retirement
      from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the
      company. He frequently made cameo appearances in films and television
      shows based on Marvel properties on which he received an executive
      producer credit, which allowed him to become the highest-grossing person
      in film of all time by a large margin.[2] He continued independent
      creative ventures into his 90s until his death in 2018. Lee was inducted
      into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and
      the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal
      of Arts in 2008. Biography

      Early life: Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in
      Manhattan, New York City,[3] in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish
      immigrant parents, Celia (nÃ©e Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of
      West 98th Street and West End Avenue.[4][5] Lee was raised in a Jewish
      household. In a 2002 interview, he stated when asked if he believed in
      God, "Well, let me put it this way... [Pauses.] No, I'm not going to try
      to be clever. I really don't know. I just don't know."[6] On another
      interview from 2011, when asked about his Romanian origins and his
      relationship with the country, he said that he had never visited it and
      that he did not know Romanian because his parents never taught it to
      him.[7] Lee's father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically
      after the Great Depression.[4] The family moved further uptown to Fort
      Washington Avenue,[8] in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee had one
      younger brother named Larry Lieber.[9] He said in 2006 that as a child he
      was influenced by books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn
      playing heroic roles.[10] Reading The Scarlet Pimpernel, he called the
      title character "the first superhero I had read about, the first character
      who could be called a superhero."[11] By the time Lee was in his teens,
      the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The
      Bronx. Lee described it as "a third-floor apartment facing out back". Lee
      and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout
      couch.[9] Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.[12] In his
      youth, Lee enjoyed writing, and entertained dreams of writing the "Great
      American Novel" one day.[13] He said that in his youth he worked such
      part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases
      for the National Tuberculosis Center;[14] delivering sandwiches for the
      Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office
      boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on
      Broadway;[15] and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune
      newspaper.[16] At fifteen, Lee entered a high school essay competition
      sponsored by the New York Herald Tribune, called "The Biggest News of the
      Week Contest." Lee claimed to have won the prize for three straight weeks,
      goading the newspaper to write him and ask him to let someone else win.
      The paper suggested he look into writing professionally, which Lee claimed
      "probably changed my life."[17] He graduated from high school early, aged
      sixteen and a half,[why?][how?] in 1939 and joined the WPA Federal Theatre
      Project.[18]
